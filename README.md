# Redux Feedback Loop

For this weekend challenge we were asked to make a feedback page that utilized redux/react. 
The exercise was to learn how to carry and store local state and redux state, and display it on the DOM. 

### SETUP

Create database and tables using the provided `data.sql` file. Start the server.

```
npm install
npm run server
```

Now that the server is running, open a new terminal tab with `cmd + t` and start the react client app.

```
npm run client
```

## Deployment

Currently deployed on heroku at: https://feedback-redux.herokuapp.com/#/
